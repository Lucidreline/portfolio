## üíª Installation

Download this repo:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Lucidreline/portfolio.git
```

Install dependencies:
```bash

## üëî Tailor it for you

Once you open the project folder you can start to add in your projects and information.

To add your projects, go to following file in the project folder:
```bash
/src/components/sections/projects/projects.data.js
```
This file is just a regular javascript array. Enter your projects in this array like so:
```javascript
{
      name: 'Your Project Name',
      url: 'https://project.url/',
      github: 'https://url_to_github_repo/project',
      photo:
        'a_picture_of_your_project.png',
      technologies: 'HTLM5, CSS3',
      description:
        'A little description of what you made :).',
    }
```

Take a look at the file on Github for an example: https://github.com/Lucidreline/portfolio/blob/master/src/components/sections/projects/projects.data.js

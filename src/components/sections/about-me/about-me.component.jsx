        <p>
          Hello! I am a Computer Science student based in Los Angeles, CA. I
          wrote my first line of code right after graduating high school in 2018
          and immediately grew a passion for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I began my web development journey in late 2018. After seeing how I
          was able to build a beautiful user interface for my apps, it became
          impossible for me to leave web development.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>
